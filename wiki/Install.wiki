== Download ==

For now, !LangBots is available throught the subversion repository:

$ svn checkout http://langbots.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ langbots

== Dependencies ==

You need:
 - [http://python.org/ Python].
 - [http://www.pygame.org/ PyGame].
 - [http://pyyaml.org/ PyYAML].

== How to execute ==

For now the framework is not installable, so we run it from the sources directory. You must then set the PYTHONPATH to include the directory so it can find the *langbots* module:

{{{
$ cd /path/to/langbots
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
}}}

And now you should be able to run the main script:

{{{
$ langbots/main.py
}}}
